# OCR2Text

A deep learning pipeline designed during the AI4Good hackathon, 
 in an attempt to solve the OCR2Text challenge, where one is asked to translate numbers in the image to text.
 
The general pipeline only has limited efficacy, perhaps due to the limited amount of data, or the limitation imposed by the selection of neural architectures or hyperparams.

An investigation into the image data proprocessing, i.e. segmentation and augmentation, is still ongoing.
