# Handwritten clinical records for Optical Character Recognition 

The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) has tasked Charitable Analytics
International (CAI) to develop a solution to it's digitization problem. WFP operates in
over 80 countries, where they deliver much needed supplies to health clinics, schools,
refugee camps, etc.

The areas where they operate often lack access to electricity, internet and cellphone coverage, and staff with
computer knowledge. These constraints make recording on paper the only form of bookkeeping possible. 
Lacking effective tools to digitize logbooks, WFP’s only option is to transport them back to a large 
city where every page is input manually. This process is tedious, expensive and prone to errors.

CAI is developing a software stack which would allow field workers to send photographs of their logbooks to a WhatsApp
phone number. The receiving WhatsApp account pushes the pictures to an image processing and visualization server.
One of the programs running on the server finds the spreadsheet in the images and cuts out every individual cell.

Our challenge for the AI4Good Hackathon is to develop a program able to convert the handwritten characters 
contained in the cell images into typed text. The provided training set contains labeled cell images of 
handwritten numerical values. They come from health clinics in the Republic of Congo. 
Use it to build your model and submit your validation set to our web server to see how you have done!

## Quantitative Description of the Dataset

Training/Test Set = 7,202 labeled cells

Validation Set = 522 unlabeled cells

Format : Grayscale images of varying width and height

The images contain values expressed by this regex,
    
    ^[\-]?[0-9]*[\.\,]?[0-9]*$


The repository is organized with the following structure :
 
	cell_images/
		|
		|-> training_set_values.txt
		|		|
		|		|-> filename;value
		|		|-> 1.jpg;97
		|		|-> 2.jpg;18
		|		|-> ...;...

## Description of Charitable Analytics International

CAI helps organizations understand their data through concrete insights. We offer
unique and customized solutions to empower leaders doing social good. We focus on
tackling pressing real-world issues that have the biggest impact, with partners such as
the United Nations World Food Program and the National Democratic Institute. Our
core belief is that data technology can and should be a key tool in the mission to make
the world a better place.


## Basics

If this is your first time at a hackathon, it's probably best that you learn some concepts that'll help ramp you up before!

- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Interactive tutorial to learn Git, the most popular version control system for collaborative programming.
- [What's an API?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82) - Learn how to use external services in your projects.
- [A Beginner’s Guide to HTTP and REST](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-http-and-rest--net-16340) - A more in-depth guide on how to use REST APIs.
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - An in-depth series of tutorials to learn how to code in Python. If you don't know what language to use, Python is a good start!
